# Big Data Homework

### Level 1

* Use the furnished schema to create tables in your RDS database.

* Create two separate Google Colab notebooks and **extract** any two datasets from the list at [review dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/index.txt), one into each notebook.

  **Note:** It is possible to ETL both data sources in a single notebook, but due to the large data sizes, it will be easier to work with these S3 data sources in two separate Colab notebooks.

* Be sure to handle the header correctly. If you read the file without the header parameter, you may find that the column headers are included in the table rows.

* For each notebook (one dataset per notebook), complete the following:

  * Count the number of records (rows) in the dataset.

  * **Transform** the dataset to fit the tables in the [schema file](Resources/schema.sql). Be sure the DataFrames match in data type and in column name.
